        I envisioned this place to be a forum, where <b>foodies</b> can share their passion.
        <p>
        We are building a community where food lovers can post a picture of their dinner plate, and see what others eat... around the same time, or somewhere nearby.
        <p>
        That's the key: time-wise and location-wise <b>nearby</b>. You can browse the feed, or browse the map. Or (soon enough) do both at the same time!
        <p>
        Go out for dinner, and take a pic of your order. Or check out others' recent posts to get a tip for today's dinner location.
        You can discvover new restaurants this way.
        <p>
        Try out your grandma's recipe at home, and <b>share your moment of pride</b> with the world.
